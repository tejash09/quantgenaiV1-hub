    shortDescription: 'Algorithms that improve automatically through experience',
    description: 'Machine learning is a field of inquiry devoted to understanding and building methods that "learn" – that is, methods that leverage data to improve performance on some set of tasks. It is seen as a part of artificial intelligence.',
    overview:'Machine learning enables computers to automatically discover patterns in data and make predictions without being explicitly programmed. It is widely used in various domains, including healthcare, finance, robotics, and more.',
    keypoints:'Machine learning relies on several fundamental concepts that guide its development and application:',
    p1:'Supervised Learning: The model learns from labeled data, mapping inputs to known outputs (e.g., spam email detection).',
    p2:'Unsupervised Learning: The model finds patterns and structures in unlabeled data (e.g., customer segmentation).',
    p3:'Reinforcement Learning: The model learns by interacting with the environment and receiving rewards or penalties (e.g., game-playing AI).',
    p4:'Overfitting and Underfitting: Overfitting occurs when a model learns noise instead of the actual pattern, while underfitting happens when it fails to learn sufficiently.',
    p5:'Feature Engineering: Selecting and transforming input variables to improve the model\'s performance',
    p6:'Model Evaluation: Methods such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score help assess a model\'s effectiveness.',
